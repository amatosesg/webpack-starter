# Webpack Starter Template

This is a project to create apps with webpack.

### Notes: 
1. 'src' are empty and in default mode. Feel free to change the architecture structure. If you rename any existent component remember to check webpack configs.

2. Remember to install node_modules:
```
npm install
```
3. To build, you have 2 options.
For production:
```
npm run build
```
or for development:
```
npm run build:dev
```
4. To run server (default port: 8080):
```
npm run serve
```
